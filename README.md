# heart_disease_predict_ml
Using ***Logistic Regression*** model to predict heart disease based on dataset.

This project was given as a test, with the objective of using
machine learning models to predict heart disease in patients.

**Files supplied:**

-CVD_train2.csv  
-CVD_test2.csv  
-sample_submission.csv

**My analysis:**  

-heart_disease_predict.ipynb

**The outcome generated by the analysis file:** 

-output_predictions.csv

**The steps involved include:**  

-Data transformation  
-Encoding of categorical data  
-Scaling of numerical data  
-Feature analysis and selection  
-Training the Logistic Regression model  
-Generating the ouput_predictions in same format as sample submission

***Please see heart_disease_predict.ipynb for more insights.***
