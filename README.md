# heart_disease_predict_ml
Using Logistic Regression model to predict heart disease based on dataset.

This project was given as a test, with the objective of using
machine learning models to predict heart disease in patients.

Files supplied:
-CVD_train2.csv
-CVD_test2.csv
-sample_submission.csv

My analysis:
-heart_disease__predict.ipynb

The outcome generated by the analysis file:
-output_predictions.csv

The steps involved include:
-Data transformation
-Encoding of categorical data
-Scaling of numerical data
-Feature analysis and selection
-Training the Logistic Regression model
-Generating the ouput_predictions in same format as sample submission
